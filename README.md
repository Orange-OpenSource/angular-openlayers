# angular-openlayers

## Brief
angular-openlayers is a set of AngularJS directives for openlayers3.

Unlike alternatives (angular-openlayers-directive, ngeo, etc), angular-openlayers is a very thin abstraction layer on top of OpenLayers3, meaning that angular-openlayers directives have the same attributes as the underlying OpenLayers objects.
It means that anyone familiar to OpenLayers3 will be proficient in an instant with angular-openlayers.
